## Doctor Logger
This is a simple interactive app that physicians can use to schedule the times they are on call.
You can add or remove physicians, automatically generate a schedule, clear schedules, and generate a printer-friendly version of
your work schedule.

App is live at http://www.juanitotaveras.com/doctor_logger/index.php

## Files
Written in PHP, Javascript (with Jquery), and SQL.
./indexphp is the main file, builds page
other php files are used for AJAX.

## TODO
1. Number of weekends worked per doctor is only updated when you refresh the page. Need to write functions that update without refreshing.
2. Some bugs in month_generator_function when new doctor is added.
3. Add support for viewing on mobile device.
